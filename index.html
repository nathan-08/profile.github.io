      <h2>Ver Redux (The Return of Spring)</h2>
      <p>My inspiration for this poem is the blossoming of flowers in springtime.</p>
      <p>
      Quum albulos flores arboris in ramis aspicio,<br>
      Quam valde pulchritudinem admiror reducem;<br>
      Et laetor animo, nam manifestum est:<br>
      Proserpinam ex inferis redisse.<br>
      </p>

  Assembly programming is interesting because it shows us how higher level programming languages are implemented. We learn about the basic programming constructs: the sequential, the iterative, and the conditional. Basically all we have access to, in the case of the LC3 assembly, is addition, subtraction and conditional branches. This limited set of tools makes very basic tasks quite a challenge! But it also helps us understand why high-level languages, such as C, are they way they are.

  A very useful tool that I have learned about assembly programming is the TRAP service routines. These are functions written into the operating system, and they enable the programmer to call upon the operating system to do certain tasks. Many of these have to do with I/O operations. Pointers to these functions are contained in the LC3 memory locations x00 through xFF. This section of memory is called the Trap Vector Table.

  Bertrand Russell's Principia Mathematica is a formal language which is an early precursor to programming languages. He introduces concepts such as data-types, functions, classes, definitions etc. Russel was inspired by Gottlob Frege, who researched the foundations of arithmetic in his 1893 book, Grundgesetze der Arithmetik. It is curious how symbolic systems such as programming languages work. They seem to mirror some structural aspect of reality.
